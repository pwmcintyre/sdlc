# Agent Instructions

This file contains project-specific instructions for AI agents working on this codebase.

We are using Reveal which renders markdown to slides using a VS Code plugin, see @sample.md for syntax

## Slide Formatting Preferences

- **No fragment animations**: Do not use `{.fragment}` in slides.md. All content should appear immediately when the slide is displayed.
