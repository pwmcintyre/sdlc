- What is "software engineering"?
- Method
- AI
- Questions

## My Story

- Video Games
- Calculators
- Studied; Opportunity!

## What even is this industry?

Desire versus possibility

---

### Academic vs Industrial

1. Desire exists (users want it)
2. Technology doesn't exist (infeasible)
3. 👨‍💻 Workarounds accumulate (complexity builds)
4. 🔬 Technology breakthrough (constraint removed)
5. 👨‍💻 **DELETE all the workarounds**

---

### Example: Natural Language Interfaces

- **Desired since 1950s:** Talk to computers naturally
- **Impossible until 2017:** Rule-based NLP was fragile
- **Workarounds:** GUIs, menus, training manuals, syntax
- **Breakthrough:** Transformers, GPT, ChatGPT (2022)
- **Result:** Delete 90% of traditional UI complexity

---

## What is Software Delivery?

Plan → Build → Test → Release → Monitor

*It's a continuous loop, and never this simple*

---

## SDLC, Agile, DevOps

- **SDLC:** The framework (the "what")
- **Agile:** Working iteratively (the "how")
- **DevOps:** Automation & continuous delivery (the "shipping")

---

### Agile Manifesto

Written in 2001 by 17 software developers
Goal: improve software development processes

- Individuals + interactions > processes + tools
- Working software > comprehensive documentation
- Deliver working software frequently
- Responding to change over following a plan

---

### Agile in Practice

- Sprint planning (2-week cycles)
- Daily standups (what did you do? blockers?)
- Code reviews (catch bugs, share knowledge)
- Retrospectives (what can improve?)

---

## DevOps

- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Monitoring and observability
- Incident response and blameless postmortems

---

## CI/CD: Confidence Through Automation

**Why automate?**
- Confidence through consistency
- Predictable deploys to production = sleep

> "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."

---

## Trust and Stability as Goals

Modern engineering isn't just about speed.

**Build trust in:**
- The code (tests, reviews, quality)
- The process (repeatable, documented)
- The team (psychological safety, collaboration)

Trust makes delivery stable, repeatable, and low-stress.

---

## Surprisingly Hard Things

- Time (timezones, leap seconds, distributed clocks)
- Names (cache invalidation, naming variables)
- Exactly once (impossible in distributed systems)
- Auth (eternal cat-and-mouse game)

These don't get solved. They get managed.

---

## The Phoenix Principle

> From The Phoenix Project: "If something is painful, do it more often."

**Examples:**
- Deployments scary? Deploy daily → becomes routine
- Releases stressful? Release weekly → builds confidence
- Testing tedious? Automate it → removes friction

Frequent practice turns anxiety into normalcy.

---

## Making Tradeoffs

Perfect solution:
- 100% test coverage
- Takes 6 months

Good enough:
- 80% test coverage
- Ships in 6 weeks

Shipping imperfect software beats perfect software that never ships.

---

## Career Progression

Know your expectations:

- **Junior** Learn basics, be resourceful
- **Mid:** Own features, mentor juniors
- **Senior:** Provid advice, ship features
- **Lead:** Design systems, architectural decisions
- **Principal:** Set technical direction, org-wide impact

---

## Your First Job

- You won't know everything (nobody does)
- Imposter syndrome is normal
- Ask questions - it's expected
- Find a mentor
- Own your mistakes and learn

---

## Continuous Learning

Technology changes constantly.

**Ways to keep learning:**
- Read other people's code
- Build side projects
- Contribute to open source
- Learn from production incidents
- Focus on fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, design patterns)

---

## Red Flags in Companies

- No code reviews or testing
- Constant firefighting
- Blame culture
- No documentation
- Unlimited overtime expectations

---

## Green Flags in Companies

- Strong engineering culture
- Automated CI/CD
- Blameless postmortems
- Time for tech debt and learning
- Good documentation
- Work-life balance
---

## The Impact of AI

**What's changing:**
- Natural language interfaces replacing complex UIs
- AI-assisted coding (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code)

**What's not changing:**
- Need to understand fundamentals
- System design and architecture
- Human judgment and tradeoffs

---

## AI: Deletion Opportunity

Before LLMs:
- Search engines
- Administrative overhead
- Complex UI's

After LLMs:
- Answer engines
- Agentic assistants
- Conversational interfaces
