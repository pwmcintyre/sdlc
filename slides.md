- No idea, no plan
- Opportunity!
- Mainframes > Cloud > Versent

---

## What even is this industry?

Desire versus possibility

---

### Academic vs Industrial

1. Desire exists (users want it)
2. Technology doesn't exist (infeasible)
3. 👨‍💻 Workarounds accumulate (complexity builds)
4. 🔬 Technology breakthrough (constraint removed)
5. 👨‍💻 **DELETE all the workarounds**

---

### Example: Natural Language Interfaces

- **Desired since 1950s:** Talk to computers naturally
- **Impossible until 2017:** Rule-based NLP was fragile
- **Workarounds:** GUIs, menus, training manuals, syntax
- **Breakthrough:** Transformers, GPT, ChatGPT (2022)
- **Result:** Delete 90% of traditional UI complexity

---

## What is Software Delivery?

Plan → Build → Test → Release → Monitor

*It's a continuous loop, and never this simple*

---

## SDLC, Agile, DevOps

- **SDLC:** The framework (the "what")
- **Agile:** Working iteratively (the "how")
- **DevOps:** Automation & continuous delivery (the "shipping")

---

## The Reality

- Context switching is inevitable
- You can't control everything
- Everything fails eventually
- Production issues interrupt everything
- Requirements change mid-sprint

---

## Random Concepts

---

### Un/known Quadrants

> "There are known knowns... known unknowns... but also unknown unknowns."
> — Donald Rumsfeld

( Awareness vs Understanding )

---

### Code is a Liability

> "Don't write code if you don't have to."
> — Kelsey Hightower #nocode

https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode

> No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications.
> Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

---

### Concept: Choose Boring Technology

> "Let's say every company gets about three innovation tokens."
> — Dan McKinley

Spend them on your competitive advantage, not databases.

---

## Enduring Skills

- Technical writing
- Working in a team
- Source control (Git)
- Networking / computer fundamentals (BS filter)

---

## Surprisingly Hard Things

- Time (timezones, leap seconds, distributed clocks)
- Names (cache invalidation, naming variables)
- Exactly once (impossible in distributed systems)
- Auth (eternal cat-and-mouse game)

These don't get solved. They get managed.

---

## The Simplicity Paradox

> If I had more time...
> I'd have written a shorter letter.
> — Blaise Pascal

Complexity is easy.
Simplicity is hard.

---

## CI/CD: Confidence Through Automation

**Why automate?**
- Reduce friction and risk
- Build confidence through consistency
- Make deployment predictable, not stressful

> "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."

Automation removes anxiety.

---

## Cloud Infrastructure

**Compute:** EC2, containers, Lambda (serverless)

**Storage:** S3, databases (RDS, DynamoDB)

**Monitoring:** Logs, metrics, alerts

**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, CloudFormation

---

## Trust and Stability as Goals

Modern engineering isn't just about speed.

**Build trust in:**
- The code (tests, reviews, quality)
- The process (repeatable, documented)
- The team (psychological safety, collaboration)

Trust makes delivery stable, repeatable, and low-stress.

---

## Working in Teams

- Daily standups (what did you do? blockers?)
- Sprint planning (2-week cycles)
- Code reviews (catch bugs, share knowledge)
- Retrospectives (what can improve?)

Software engineering is a team sport.

---

## Real Challenges

**Production incidents:**
- Not "if", but "when"
- On-call rotation
- Blameless postmortems

**Legacy code:**
- You'll read more than you write
- Technical debt accumulates
- Balance features vs. paying down debt

---

## The Phoenix Principle

> From The Phoenix Project: "If something is painful, do it more often."

**Examples:**
- Deployments scary? Deploy daily → becomes routine
- Releases stressful? Release weekly → builds confidence
- Testing tedious? Automate it → removes friction

Frequent practice turns anxiety into normalcy.

---

## Making Tradeoffs

Perfect solution:
- 100% test coverage
- Takes 6 months

Good enough:
- 80% test coverage
- Ships in 6 weeks

Shipping imperfect software beats perfect software that never ships.

---

## Career Progression

- **Junior (0-2 years):** Learn basics, fix bugs
- **Mid (2-5 years):** Own features, mentor juniors
- **Senior (5-10 years):** Design systems, architectural decisions
- **Principal (10+ years):** Set technical direction, org-wide impact

Focus on impact, not titles.

---

## Your First Job

- You won't know everything (nobody does)
- Imposter syndrome is normal
- Ask questions - it's expected
- Find a mentor
- Own your mistakes and learn

---

## Continuous Learning

Technology changes constantly.

**Ways to keep learning:**
- Read other people's code
- Build side projects
- Contribute to open source
- Learn from production incidents
- Focus on fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, design patterns)

---

## Red Flags in Companies

- No code reviews or testing
- Constant firefighting
- Blame culture
- No documentation
- Unlimited overtime expectations

---

## Green Flags in Companies

- Strong engineering culture
- Automated CI/CD
- Blameless postmortems
- Time for tech debt and learning
- Good documentation
- Work-life balance

---

## Skills Beyond Code

- **Communication:** Explaining technical concepts clearly
- **Empathy:** Understanding users and team dynamics
- **Time management:** Balancing priorities
- **Problem-solving:** Breaking down complexity
- **Adaptability:** Technologies and priorities change

These become more important as you advance.

---

## The Impact of AI

**What's changing:**
- Natural language interfaces replacing complex UIs
- AI-assisted coding (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code)
- Less code = Less maintenance

**What's not changing:**
- Need to understand fundamentals
- System design and architecture
- Human judgment and tradeoffs

---

## AI: Deletion Opportunity

Before LLMs:
- Hierarchical menus
- Training manuals
- Complex wizards
- Keyboard shortcuts to memorize

After LLMs:
- Text box: "What do you want?"
- Natural conversation
- Zero training needed

---

## Key Takeaways

- Master the basics: Git, CLI, containers
- Choose boring technology, spend innovation tokens wisely
- Code is a liability - celebrate deletions
- Simplicity is hard work, complexity is easy
- Watch when technology shifts impossibility boundaries
- Communication > solo coding
- Keep learning, stay curious
- Find good engineering culture
