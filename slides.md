# Software Engineering

## Agenda

- My story
- What is "software engineering"?
- Method
- AI
- Questions

---

## My Story

- Video Games
- Calculators
- Studied > Opportunity!
- Mainframes > Cloud > Consulting

> Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity
> — Seneca

---

## What even is this industry?

Desire versus possibility

---

### Academic vs Industrial

> The great growling engine of change - technology
> — Alvin Toffler

Demand → 👨‍💻 Iterate → 🔬 Breakthrough → 👨‍💻 Simplify ⟲

---

### Example: Natural Language Interfaces

- **Desired since 1950s:** Talk to computers naturally
- **Impossible until 2017:** Rule-based NLP was fragile
- **Workarounds:** GUIs, menus, training manuals, syntax
- **Breakthrough:** Transformers, GPT, ChatGPT (2022)
- **Result:** Delete 90% of traditional UI complexity

---

## What is Software Delivery?

Plan → Build → Test → Release → Monitor ⟲

*It's a continuous loop, and never this simple*

---

## SDLC, Agile, DevOps

- **SDLC:** The framework (the "what")
- **Agile:** Working iteratively (the "how")
- **DevOps:** Automation & continuous delivery (the "shipping")

---

### Agile Manifesto

Written in 2001 by 17 software developers
Goal: improve software development processes

- Individuals + interactions > processes + tools
- Working software > comprehensive documentation
- Deliver working software frequently
- Responding to change over following a plan

---

### Agile in Practice

- Sprint planning (2-week cycles)
- Daily standups (what did you do? blockers?)
- Code reviews (catch bugs, share knowledge)
- Retrospectives (what can improve?)

---

## DevOps

- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Monitoring and observability
- Incident response and blameless postmortems

---

## CI/CD: Confidence Through Automation

**Why automate?**
- Confidence through consistency
- Predictable deploys to production = sleep

> "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."

---

## The Phoenix Principle

> If something is painful, do it ~more~ often.
> — The Phoenix Project

**Examples:**
- Deployments scary? more!
- Releases stressful? more!!
- Testing tedious? MORE!!!!1

---

## Tradeoffs

> Perfection is the enemy of progress.
> — Voltaire

Perfect: 100% test coverage? Takes 6 months ✋

Good enough: 80% test coverage? Ships in 6 weeks 🤘

---

## Surprisingly Hard Things

- Time (timezones, leap seconds, distributed clocks)
- Names (cache invalidation, naming variables)
- Exactly once (impossible in distributed systems)
- Security (eternal cat-and-mouse game)

These don't get solved. They get managed.

---

## Career Progression

Know your expectations:

- **Junior** Learn basics, be resourceful
- **Mid:** Own features, mentor juniors
- **Senior:** Provid advice, ship features
- **Lead:** Design systems, architectural decisions
- **Principal:** Set technical direction, org-wide impact

---

## Your First Job

(and every job after that)

- Expect to be overwhelmed
- Imposter syndrome is normal
- Ask questions
- Find a mentor
- Own your mistakes

---

## Continuous Learning

- Read other people's code
- Read other languages
- Side projects
- Read about incidents / hacks
- Learn fundamentals

---

## Red Flags in Companies

- No code reviews or testing
- Constant firefighting
- Blame culture
- No documentation
- Unlimited overtime expectations

---

## Green Flags in Companies

- Strong engineering culture
- Automated CI/CD
- Blameless postmortems
- Time for tech debt and learning
- Good documentation
- Work-life balance
---

## The Impact of AI

---

### What's changing

- Natural language interfaces replacing complex UIs
- AI-assisted coding (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code)

### What's not changing

- Need to understand fundamentals
- System design and architecture
- Human judgment and tradeoffs

---

## Opportunity

---

### Before LLMs

- Search engines
- Administrative overhead
- Complex UI's

### After LLMs

- Answer engines
- Agentic assistants
- Conversational interfaces
