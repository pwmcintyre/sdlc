# Desire Meets Possibility: When Technology Shifts the Boundary

---

## Slide 1: The Negotiation Triangle

### Product Features as a Three-Way Negotiation

> "Design thinking brings together what is desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically feasible and economically viable."
>
> — IDEO Design Thinking Framework

**Product features exist at the intersection of:**

```
        DESIRABILITY
       (What users want)
              ▲
              |
              |
   FEASIBILITY ◄─────► VIABILITY
 (Can we build it?)  (Can we sustain it?)
```

### The Constant Tension

**Desirability:** Users want instant EV charging (like gas pumps)
**Feasibility:** Technology doesn't exist yet
**Result:** Feature remains impossible... until it isn't

### The Three Questions Every Feature Must Answer

| Question | What It Addresses | Risk if Ignored |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Do users want it?** | Desirability | Build something nobody uses |
| **Can we build it?** | Feasibility | Promise what's impossible |
| **Can we sustain it?** | Viability | Unsustainable business model |

**The challenge:** These three factors are often in conflict.

**Example tension:**
- Highly desirable feature (users love it!)
- Requires expensive tech (feasible but costly)
- Price point kills viability (can't sustain business)

### Alan Kay's Perspective

> "Technology is anything invented after you were born, everything else is just stuff."
>
> — Alan Kay

**The insight:** Each generation's "impossible" becomes the next generation's "trivial."

**What this means:**
- Your parents marveled at color TV
- You marvel at smartphones
- Your kids take AI for granted

**The boundary of feasibility is constantly moving.**

## Slide 2: From Impossible to Trivial - Historical Shifts

### The Pattern

```
Desire exists for decades
    ↓
Technology can't deliver (infeasible)
    ↓
Workarounds accumulate (complexity builds)
    ↓
Technology breakthrough
    ↓
Feature becomes trivial
    ↓
DELETE all the workarounds
```

### Example 1: Natural Language Interfaces

**The desire (1950s-2010s):**
- Talk to computers naturally
- No commands, no syntax, just conversation
- Featured in every sci-fi movie (Star Trek, 2001: A Space Odyssey)

**The impossibility:**
- Rule-based NLP was fragile and limited
- Speech recognition was 70-80% accurate (unusable)
- Understanding context was impossible
- Required perfect grammar and vocabulary

**The workarounds (1980s-2010s):**
- Command-line interfaces (learn syntax)
- GUI with buttons and menus (point and click)
- Structured forms (constrain user input)
- Training manuals (teach users to speak computer)

**The breakthrough (2017-2023):**
- Transformer architecture ("Attention Is All You Need", 2017)
- BERT and GPT (2018)
- GPT-3 (175B parameters, 2020)
- ChatGPT (2022) - "hit the NLP community like an asteroid"

**The result:**
```
Before: Natural language = Research problem
After:  Natural language = Default interface

"In a day, many problems researchers were working on simply disappeared."
```

**Previously impossible, now trivial:**
- Writing code by describing what you want
- Translating 101 languages in real-time
- Conversational search and Q&A
- Natural language database queries
- Text-to-image generation
- Voice assistants that actually understand context

**The deletion opportunity:**
- Complex GUIs → Simple text box
- Training manuals → "Just ask"
- Specialized syntax → Natural conversation
- **90% of traditional UI complexity can now be deleted**

### Example 2: The iPhone Multi-Touch Revolution (2007)

**The desire (1990s-2000s):**
- Touch-based phone interface
- No stylus, no physical keyboard
- Finger-friendly, intuitive gestures
- "Star Trek PADD" experience

**The impossibility:**
- Touchscreens existed but required styluses (Palm Pilot)
- Finger touch was imprecise (fat finger problem)
- On-screen keyboards were unusable
- Resistive screens needed pressure

**The workarounds (1990s-2000s):**
- Physical keyboards (BlackBerry, Nokia)
- Stylus-based input (Palm, Windows Mobile)
- T9 predictive text on number pads
- Tiny keyboards with thumbs

**The breakthrough (2007):**
- **Capacitive multi-touch** (detect multiple simultaneous touches)
- **AI-powered predictive keyboard** (expand hit regions based on context)
  - If you type "T", hit region for "H" grows
  - Predicts next letter and adjusts targeting
- **Physicalist software** (objects obey intuitive physics)
  - Swipe, pinch, zoom feel natural
  - Momentum, friction, bounce-back

**Steve Jobs' claim:** "Literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone."

**The result:**
```
Before: Physical keyboard required (BlackBerry era)
After:  Touch interfaces standard (styluses disappeared)
```

**What got deleted:**
- Physical keyboards on phones (BlackBerry died)
- Styluses (except for specialized use)
- Complex menu navigation
- "Mobile-specific" simplified interfaces

### Example 3: Smartphone Convergence

**The desires (1980s-2000s):**
- Portable phone + camera + GPS + music player + computer
- "Swiss Army knife" device
- One device for everything

**The impossibility:**
- Each required separate device with dedicated hardware
- Battery technology couldn't support multiple radios
- Processing power insufficient
- Size/weight constraints
- GPS chips were expensive ($500+) and power-hungry
- Cameras required optical components

**The workarounds (1990s-2000s):**
```
Carry separately:
- Mobile phone (calls/texts)
- Digital camera (photos)
- GPS navigator (Garmin, TomTom)
- iPod/MP3 player (music)
- PDA (calendar, contacts)
- Laptop (computing)

Total: 6+ devices, multiple chargers, bag full of gadgets
```

**The breakthroughs (2005-2015):**
- **Miniaturization** (sensors, GPS chips, cameras fit in phones)
- **Battery technology** (lithium-ion improvements)
- **Mobile processors** (ARM architecture, low power consumption)
- **CMOS sensors** (camera quality in tiny form factor)
- **Computer vision** (facial recognition, AR)
- **Cloud computing** (offload heavy processing)

**The result:**
```
1999: 6 separate devices (phone, camera, GPS, iPod, PDA, laptop)
2007: iPhone converges 5 into one device
2025: Even budget smartphones have:
      - Multi-lens cameras with computational photography
      - Real-time AR with LiDAR depth mapping
      - Facial recognition (computer vision)
      - Real-time translation (NLP)
      - Voice assistants (speech recognition)
      - 5G connectivity
      - All-day battery life
```

**Previously impossible, now taken for granted.**

**What got deleted:**
- Standalone GPS devices (Garmin pivoted to fitness)
- Point-and-shoot cameras (market collapsed)
- MP3 players (iPod discontinued 2022)
- Dedicated e-readers (mostly - Kindle survives)
- Portable gaming devices (Nintendo Switch is last stand)

## Slide 3: The Feature-Technology Dance

### The Cycle of Desire and Possibility

```
1. Desire exists (users want it)
   ↓
2. Technology can't deliver (infeasible)
   ↓
3. Workarounds accumulate (complex solutions)
   ↓
4. Technology breakthrough (constraint removed)
   ↓
5. Feature becomes trivial
   ↓
6. DELETE all workarounds ← Critical step!
   ↓
7. New desires emerge (raise the bar)
   ↓
   [Repeat]
```

### Real-World Examples of This Pattern

**Voice Recognition:**
- **1990s desire:** Dictation software for writing
- **Impossibility:** 70% accuracy, required 30-min voice training per user
- **Workarounds:** Typing, transcription services, secretaries
- **Breakthrough:** Deep learning speech models (2010s), 95%+ accuracy
- **Now trivial:** 150 words/minute dictation, works out of box
- **Deletion opportunity:** Remove all click-heavy UIs, enable voice-first interfaces

**Real-Time Translation:**
- **Desire (1960s):** Universal translator (Star Trek)
- **Impossibility:** "Considered nearly impossible task" until 2010s
- **Workarounds:** Human translators, phrasebooks, language learning
- **Breakthrough:** Neural machine translation (2016+), LLMs (2020+)
- **Now trivial:** 101 languages, real-time speech-to-speech
- **Deletion opportunity:** Remove language-specific app versions, localization overhead

**Computer Vision:**
- **Desire (1990s):** Face unlock, AR, object recognition
- **Impossibility:** Required massive compute, was unreliable
- **Workarounds:** Passwords, PINs, physical keys, QR codes
- **Breakthrough:** CNNs, mobile neural chips (2015+)
- **Now trivial:** Every phone has facial recognition, real-time AR
- **Deletion opportunity:** Remove passwords, physical keys, manual data entry

**Image Generation:**
- **Desire (1980s):** Create custom images by description
- **Impossibility:** Required artists, designers, weeks of work
- **Workarounds:** Stock photos, hire designers, learn Photoshop
- **Breakthrough:** Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney (2022)
- **Now trivial:** "A cat riding a bicycle in space" → instant image
- **Deletion opportunity:** Stock photo subscriptions, basic design work

### The Strategic Implication

**For product teams:**

**Watch the impossibility boundary:**
1. What's desired but infeasible today?
2. Which constraints are **technological**? (might change soon)
3. Which constraints are **fundamental**? (physics, won't change)

**When technology shifts:**
1. **Delete complexity** built to work around old limitations
2. **Rethink the interface** from first principles
3. **Question inherited constraints** from the old paradigm
4. **Compete on new dimensions** (everyone has the new tech)

### Example: ChatGPT's Interface Deletion

**Before LLMs (traditional software):**
```
Complex interface required:
- Hierarchical menus (File, Edit, View...)
- Toolbar buttons (icons to memorize)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V...)
- Settings panels (dozens of options)
- Training manuals (RTFM)
- Wizard workflows (step 1, 2, 3...)
- Context-specific commands
```

**After LLMs (ChatGPT):**
```
Simple interface:
- Text box: "What do you want?"
- Natural conversation
- Zero training needed
- Learns from context
```

**What got deleted:**
- 90% of traditional UI complexity
- Training manuals
- Tooltips and help systems
- Most menus and buttons
- Wizards and multi-step flows

**The ultimate subtraction:** Technology made the interface itself (mostly) unnecessary.

### The Deletion Rule

**When feasibility boundaries move:**

❌ **Don't:** Keep old workarounds "just in case"
✅ **Do:** Ruthlessly delete everything built to compensate for old constraints

**Example: When iPhone launched**
- Mobile websites could delete "WAP" versions
- Could delete simplified mobile UIs
- Could delete assumption of physical keyboards
- Could use full JavaScript (iPhone had real browser)

**Teams that deleted fast won.**
**Teams that kept both interfaces for "compatibility" lost.**

### Final Wisdom

**The best features are the ones you don't have to build...**
- ...because technology made them trivial
- ...so you can delete the workarounds
- ...and focus on the next impossible thing

**Three rules for navigating desire vs. possibility:**

1. **Separate temporary constraints from permanent ones**
   - Temporary: "AI can't do this yet" (might change)
   - Permanent: "Users need to see the output" (won't change)

2. **Build workarounds, but plan to delete them**
   - Document: "When tech X improves, delete this"
   - Don't over-invest in workarounds
   - Make workarounds easy to remove (isolate in modules)

3. **Watch the feasibility boundary and delete fast**
   - When constraints lift, competitors will build the simple solution
   - Your complex workaround becomes technical debt overnight
   - Speed of deletion = competitive advantage

**The meta-lesson:**

Product features are a **negotiation** between desire and possibility.

Technology breakthroughs **shift the boundary**.

Winners **delete complexity** when constraints disappear.

**Watch the feasibility boundary. When it moves, ruthlessly delete everything built to compensate for the old constraints.**
