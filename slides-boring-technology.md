# Choose Boring Technology

## Slide 1: The Innovation Token Budget

> "Let's say every company gets about three innovation tokens. You can spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while."
>
> — Dan McKinley, 2015

### The Hidden Cost of Shiny

**Each "innovation token" spent on:**
- New database technology (MongoDB, CouchDB)
- Novel programming language (Go, Rust, Elixir)
- Unproven infrastructure (Kubernetes in 2015, service mesh)

**Costs you:**
- Learning curve time
- Unknown failure modes
- Limited Stack Overflow answers
- Smaller hiring pool
- Integration challenges

**Example:** NodeJS + MongoDB + New service discovery = All 3 tokens spent before shipping features.

## Slide 2: The Power of Boring

### What Makes Tech "Boring"?

**Not about age. About understanding.**

| Boring Tech | Why It Wins |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Postgres/MySQL** | 20+ years of production bugs fixed |
| **Python/Java** | Massive talent pool, every problem solved |
| **Git** | Everyone knows it, tooling is mature |
| **Rails/Django/Laravel** | Conventions solve 80% of web problems |

### The Core Philosophy

**"Best tool for the job" is myopic thinking.**

Your job isn't picking optimal tech for each problem.
Your job is **keeping the company in business**.

**Best = Least worst** for the **most problems**.

### Known Unknowns vs Unknown Unknowns

- **Boring tech:** Known failure modes, documented workarounds
- **Shiny tech:** Unknown unknowns that surface at 3am in production

## Slide 3: The Joy Evolution Paradox

### Early Career: Excitement from Tech Itself

```
"We're using Rust microservices with gRPC and Kafka!"
```
**Joy source:** Learning new paradigms, résumé building, intellectual challenge

### Senior Career: Excitement from Doing Less

```
"We're using Rails with Postgres. It just works."
```
**Joy source:** Shipping features, solving business problems, going home on time

### The Maturity Curve

**Junior devs optimize for:** Learning, complexity, novelty
**Senior devs optimize for:** Velocity, reliability, simplicity

**The Paradox:** Boring technology enables more interesting products.

**Your product should be shiny. Your stack should be boring.**

### When to Spend Innovation Tokens

**Spend them on your competitive advantage:**
- Novel business problem that boring tech can't solve
- Domain-specific performance requirements
- Your actual differentiator

**Don't spend them on:** Databases, web frameworks, deployment (unless you're AWS)
